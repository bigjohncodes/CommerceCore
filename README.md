Here’s a refined version of your README with a more polished name and clearer formatting. I've renamed the project to **"CommerceCore API"** — a clean, professional name suitable for a scalable e-commerce backend. Let me know if you'd like a different name!

# 🛒 CommerceCore API – Scalable E-commerce Backend


Welcome to the **CommerceCore API** — a production-ready, modular, and scalable RESTful API for e-commerce applications. Built with TypeScript, Express, and TypeORM, the backend is architected with best practices including Dependency Injection, centralized error handling, and support for modern media workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dependency Injection (Awilix)**: Promotes clean code and testability with decoupled services.
- **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses compression, Helmet, and rate-limiting for security and speed.
- **Media Uploads**: Integrated with **Cloudinary** and **Sharp** for image handling.
- **Reliable Transactions**: Managed using TypeORM for robust data consistency.
- **Advanced Logging**: Powered by **Winston** for real-time debugging and auditing.
- **Interactive API Docs**: Swagger UI available at `/api-docs`.
- **Seamless Frontend Integration**: Ready to connect with the CommerceCore frontend (Shopee clone).
